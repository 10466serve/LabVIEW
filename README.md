# LabVIEW Program for FRC Robotics Competition

This repository contains the LabVIEW program developed for the **FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)**. The project is tailored to control and automate the functionalities of our team's robot during competition.  

---

## 🚀 **Overview**

This program is designed to:
- Provide robust and reliable robot control.
- Implement autonomous routines for the competition field.
- Process real-time inputs from sensors and joysticks.
- Control various actuators, including motors, pneumatics, and servos.

The software is developed entirely in LabVIEW, which provides a graphical interface for creating complex robot control systems.

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-team-name>/<repository-name>.git
   ```
2. Open the `.lvproj` file in LabVIEW.
3. Configure the IP address of your robot in the driver station software (default: `10.TE.AM.2`).
4. Build and deploy the program:
   - Navigate to **Build Specifications** in LabVIEW.
   - Click on **Build** and then **Deploy**.

## 🔄 **Autonomous Modes**

The program includes pre-configured autonomous routines:
1. **Pathfinder**: Navigate predefined trajectories.
2. **Custom Commands**: Score preloaded game pieces and perform specific tasks.
3. **Fallback Mode**: Safe operation in case of sensor failures.

Modify autonomous modes under the **Autonomous.vi** file to customize behavior for different game strategies.
